There are two midterm exams and one final exam in this course.

All tests are 3 hours long. They are open textbook (Helliwell & Sahakian) and open notes; but you may **not** use either of the two midterms or their solutions. Any notes you *personally* have made, as well as anything else I have posted on Sakai, are okay to use. You may not use any other resource (including material from past versions of the course), collaborate with, or seek help from anyone.

## Midterm 1

**Material Covered**: up to, but not including scattering

**Date**: Thursday, October 14

**Time & Location**: "take-home" style. Must be completed within a continuous 3-hour window between 11:30am-9:30pm. I have reserved Shan 2440 during this time if you would like a quiet room to work in.
