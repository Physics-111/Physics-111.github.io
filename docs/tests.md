There are two midterm exams and one final exam in this course.

All tests are 3 hours long. The midterms are open textbook (Helliwell & Sahakian) and open notes; but you may **not** use previous tests or their solutions. Any notes you *personally* have made, as well as anything else I have posted on Sakai, are okay to use. You may not use any other resource (including material from past versions of the course), collaborate with, or seek help from anyone. The final exam is closed book except for [this provided formula sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/186tC5NJHW3tp4t793oE1KHtphjsszuuW/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
